# VBA Homework - VBA of Wall Street
In this workbook, VBA code was used to summarize long excel sheets. Each sheet has approx. 750-800k entries across different stocks. A macro was created to summarize the yearly change, percent change, total stock volume, greatest % increase/decrease, and greatest volume sold. 

_Formulas_
* yearly change: opening price at a year minus closing price at end of year
* percent change: (closing price at end of year - opening price at begining of year) / (closing price at end of year)
* total stock volume: sum of volume over all days that stock was on the stock exchange
* greatest % increase: maximum of percent change
* greatest % decrease: minimum of percent change
* greatest volume sold: maximum of total stock volume
